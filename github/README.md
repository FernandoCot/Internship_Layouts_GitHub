  ** Non-Implemented Features:

    - "Search" in the Navbar
    - State Management Lib (Redux or Mobx)
    - Optionals (JWT and LocalStorage)


  PS¹: There's no route (only) "/users/", I've just set the param "user" as non-optional, so the only route that doesn't require it, is the homepage.

  PS²: I didn't have enough time to bring up any State Management Lib (such as Mobx or Redux), so I used only the Fetch in the whole project.
